# BusinessAnalytics-Forecasting Udacity
## Kaggle's New York Stock Exchange S&P 500 dataset

## Introduction
In this project we will analyze real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. You will be drawing a subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle(opens in a new tab) that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. We have created a smaller subset of the data that you will be using for the project.

## Why this Project?
In this project, you will go through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing any inferences from the statistics, calculating business metrics, and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies. The goal is for you to perform an analysis and also create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways.

## Background:
We utilized the Fundamentals.csv and Securities.csv files obtained from Kaggle. The Fundamentals file contains the fundamental financial data extracted from the SEC 10K annual filings of 448 companies listed on the S&P 500 index. The Securities file provides the industry or sector information for these companies as categorized in the S&P 500 index.

For this project we have cleaned and structured the above datasets for you and supplied you with a single clean data set. In real-life scenarios, data sets typically need to be cleaned and processed before analysis can commence. This project demonstrates what a clean data set should resemble.

## What skills will I use?
The primary objective of this project is for you to showcase your proficiency in:
-Interpreting measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, range).
-Utilizing a combination of Excel or Google Sheets functions (e.g., IF statements, INDEX, MATCH, OFFSET, VLOOKUP, calculating descriptive statistics, dropdowns, data validation).
-Analyzing and forecasting financial business metrics using Excel or Google Sheets.
-Creating visualizations of a business metric and utilizing Excel or Google Sheets.
